# usage
1 Typing python in the command line opens a python terminal
2 write a script that ends with .py to execute in bash

# general rules
 - the number of spaces + tabs at the start of a line matter
 - each line can only have one command
 - all indented lines under a function are part of the function until the first unindented line
